The codes in this file can be used to simulate the focus of designed objective chip. And it can alse be used to simulate the focus of objective with insufficient  etching width and overetched depth. 
 1. To simulate the case of insufficient etching width,  you can change the value of radius in script main.m.
 2. To simulate the case of overetched depth,  you can change the value of PP into 1.23 in script main.m.
