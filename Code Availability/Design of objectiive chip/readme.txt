The codes in this file can be used to implement the design and optimizaion of objective chips as described in supplementary section. For successful operation, there are some notices as followed:
1.  The script nonsubwavelength_FZP_data.m should be runned firstly to generate 2D matrix Amplr and Amplz. Then run the script PSO.m and obtain the radius R of objective chip.
2. The value of some paraments(such as, M, N, f, rindex) in scripts(nonsubwavelength_FZP_data.m, fitness.m, addmask.m) must be same.
3. The codes should be runned in MATLAB. And the version should be 2018a or higher.
